[@#$ 2] Section 2.02    Purchase Price.
[@#$ 3] (a)        The purchase price to be paid by Purchaser to Seller for the Servicing Rights (the “Purchase Price”) shall be an amount equal to the product of (a) the Purchase Price Percentage multiplied by (b) the actual unpaid principal balance on the Sale Date of the Mortgage Loans (but excluding the principal balances of any Mortgage Loans that (i) are ninety (90) or more days delinquent as of the Sale Date (or which became delinquent with respect to the first payment due date), (ii) that are subject to any active bankruptcy (excluding where Borrower is current on bankruptcy plan) or Mortgage Loan-level litigation proceeding in which Seller is a defendant (excluding where the litigation is covered by title insurance), and/or (iii) that are subject to any active foreclosure actions). Purchaser shall pay the Purchase Price as follows:

[@#$ 3] b) the Purchase Price, less the prior amounts paid pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(i) 
[@#$ 4] (iii)Ninety percent (90%) of the Purchase Price, less the prior amounts paid pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(i) and 2.02(a)(ii) above, will be paid no later than seven (7) Business Days after the Transfer Date and following confirmed receipt of the Escrow Funds.

For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser acknowledges that many of the items listed on Exhibit A as part of the Mortgage File are not reasonably necessary to service the Mortgage Loan in accordance with Applicable Requirements and, while such items may be relevant in contesting an Investor repurchase demand, Seller ultimately has the economic risk of any such repurchase demand by an Investor. Purchaser shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller the Exceptions List no later than thirty (30) days after the Transfer Date. After the first payment of the Holdback, Purchaser shall release the Holdback to Seller on a loan level, pro rata basis on the last Business Day of each month for each Mortgage Loan that has been fully prepaid, liquidated, or with respect to which Purchaser has received all Mortgage Loan Documents (other than the recorded Assignments of Mortgage required as a result of this transaction), which Purchaser previously identified as missing on the Exceptions List.

[@#$ 3] (c)        Within seven (7) Business Days after the Sale Date, Seller shall provide Purchaser with a final Mortgage Loan Schedule that contains final loan level information including the unpaid principal balances of the Mortgage Loans as of the Sale Date, and from which Purchaser shall calculate the final Purchase Price using such information (the “Final Purchase Price”). Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to reconcile and confirm the calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price.
[@#$ 3] (d)        Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for any outstanding Recoverable Advances for which Seller has provided Purchaser with customary documentation and support, which may be in electronic form as of the Transfer Date as set forth in Section 5.06.

Upon Seller’s request Purchaser shall furnish to Seller a copy of the related credit file and other information reasonably requested by Seller, including payment histories and collection records, to enable Seller to respond to the Investor to the extent that such credit file and other information are in the possession of Purchaser and Purchaser will allow Seller to cure, within any cure period allowed by the Investor, the condition or breach resulting in the repurchase, indemnification, or make-whole requirement. In any event, Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with a request by Seller, at Seller’s expense, for extension of any cure period allowed by the Investor. If Seller receives notice of repurchase or make-whole payment claim in a timely fashion and determines not to contest the repurchase or make-whole payment claim, Seller shall complete the repurchase within the time frame required under this Agreement and by the Investor. Within thirty (30) days of such repurchase by Seller, Purchaser shall forward to Seller all servicing records, the Mortgage File and the custodial documents, including the Mortgage Note. Purchaser shall not be responsible for the delivery of any custodial documents or Mortgage Files not delivered to Purchaser from Seller pursuant to this Agreement, nor will Purchaser be responsible for the delivery of any documents if Investor requires a make-whole payment.

However, where Purchaser has provided timely notice of the repurchase or - 32 -make-whole payment claim, (i) in the event that Seller fails to pay such amounts to the Investor and does not advance such funds to Purchaser in advance of the required repurchase or make whole date, and (ii) due to the lack of a bifurcation agreement Investor requires that such repurchase or make whole price nevertheless be paid by Purchaser, Seller shall by wire transfer of immediately available funds, reimburse Purchaser the repurchase and/or make whole price, as well as the Servicing Rights Repurchase Price. In addition, Seller shall pay to Purchaser all actual and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses borne by Purchaser in connection with any attempted cure of the applicable breach and in connection with the repurchase or make-whole of such Mortgage Loan from the Investor, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney’s fees. Upon the consummation of any such repurchase as provided above, the applicable repurchased Mortgage Loan shall be delivered to Seller, provided the Investor is not requesting a make-whole. In addition to reimbursements described in this section, in the event that indemnification is ultimately required by the applicable Investor in lieu of a repurchase or make-whole obligation, and such repurchase is caused by either (i), (ii) or (ii) of 6.04(a), Seller shall, in the sole discretion of Purchaser and in accordance with Investor Guides, repurchase the Servicing Rights from Purchaser. Seller shall in either case indemnify Purchaser for indemnifications required of it by the applicable Investor; provided however, that if Purchaser fails to provide timely notice in accordance with Section 6.04(a) and Seller is materially prejudiced by such failure to provide timely notice, and had no actual knowledge of the Investor demand or request, Seller shall be relieved of its obligation to indemnify Purchaser only to the extent of such prejudice.
[@#$ 3] (c)        Without limiting any other remedies available under this Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 6.05(c) hereof, if a breach of the representations, warranties or covenants in Section 3.01 occurs with respect to the Servicing Rights for any related Mortgage Loan and such breach has a material and adverse effect on the ability of Purchaser to service such Mortgage Loan or the value or ownership of such Servicing Rights (a “Defective Servicing Right”), then either Party upon discovery of such breach shall provide written notice thereof to the other party and to the extent that the cause of such Defective Servicing Rights is capable of being correct or cured, Seller shall have thirty (30) days to cure such breach in all material respects. If such breach is not cured within such thirty (30) day period or cannot be cured, then upon five (5) Business Days’ written notice to Seller of such Defective Servicing Right, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the Servicing Rights Repurchase Price for such Defective Servicing Right and, at the election of Seller in its sole and absolute discretion, Purchaser shall transfer the Servicing Rights back to Seller or its designee.
